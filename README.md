## **Overview**
This repository is a collection of implemented machine learning algorithms and optimizers. These are written in Python and include standard methods used in ML and optimization. The code is meant to be educational and demonstrates the implementation of key concepts from scratch, without using high-level libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Key components include:

*Machine Learning Algorithms: Basic algorithms for regression, classification, and clustering.
*Optimization Algorithms: Various techniques like gradient descent and its advanced variants.
*Loss Functions and Evaluation: Functions for training models and evaluating performance.

## **Algorithms Implemented**
***Linear Regression***
Linear regression is implemented using gradient descent for optimization. It minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual values to find the best-fitting line.

***Logistic Regression***
This implementation of logistic regression uses the sigmoid function for classification and is optimized using gradient descent. It also supports binary classification and plots the decision boundary.

***Support Vector Machines (SVM)***
This algorithm implements the basic principles of SVM, including margin maximization and the kernel trick for non-linear classification.

***K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)***
KNN is a simple, non-parametric method for classification and regression. It works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a data point and making predictions based on their labels.

***K-Means Clustering***
This unsupervised algorithm is used for clustering data points into K clusters. The implementation includes steps like assigning data points to clusters and updating centroids.

## **Optimizers Implemented**
***Gradient Descent***
This is the basic optimizer used for minimizing the cost function in various machine learning models. It updates parameters iteratively in the direction of the negative gradient.

***Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)***
A variant of gradient descent that uses a single data point to update the parameters in each iteration, which helps in faster convergence for large datasets.

***Momentum Gradient Descent***
Momentum gradient descent accelerates gradient descent by adding a velocity term to the update, reducing oscillations and speeding up convergence.

***Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG)***
This optimizer improves upon the momentum method by calculating the gradient at the "lookahead" position, which can lead to faster convergence.

***Adam Optimizer***
Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines the benefits of both Adagrad and RMSProp. It adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its first and second moments.

***Adagrad and RMSProp***
Both Adagrad and RMSProp are adaptive optimizers that adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on its historical gradient, making them useful for sparse data or large-scale datasets.

***BFGS and Quasi-Newton Methods***
These are second-order optimization methods that use approximations of the Hessian matrix to optimize the cost function more efficiently than first-order methods like gradient descent.

***Conjugate Gradient and Newtonâ€™s Method***
These methods are useful for optimizing quadratic functions and have applications in machine learning models where faster convergence is required.
